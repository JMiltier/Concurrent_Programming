### C++ sorting algorithms
This program sorts a text file of unique integers and outputs the sorted list. The text file will be an unsorted data structure [Standard Template Library (STL) vector]. This is to emulate the performance of the UNIX `sort-n` command.

Sorting Algorithms (through divide and conquer):
  1. **Quicksort** - picks element as pivot and partition exchanging
  2. **Mergesort** -
